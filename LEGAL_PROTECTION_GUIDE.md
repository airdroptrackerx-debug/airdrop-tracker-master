## ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è **Trademark Considerations**

### **Your Brand Name: "Airdrop Tracker"**

**Search Existing Trademarks:**

1. **Common Law Rights** (Free)

   - Use "‚Ñ¢" symbol next to your brand name

   - File with USPTO (if in US)
   - Use "¬Æ" symbol after registration
   - Stronger legal protection

**Note:** "Airdrop Tracker" is fairly descriptive, which may limit trademark protection. Consider:
