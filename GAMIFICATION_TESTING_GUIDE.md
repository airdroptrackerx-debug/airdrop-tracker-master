---

### **Test 3: Streak System (THIS IS THE BIG ONE!)**

#### **How Streaks Work:**
- Login today ‚Üí Streak starts at 1
- Login tomorrow (within 24 hours) ‚Üí Streak increases to 2
- Keep logging in daily ‚Üí Streak keeps growing!
- Miss a day (>24 hours) ‚Üí Streak resets to 1

#### **Testing Streak Tracking:**

**Method 1: Fresh Start**
```
1. Clear your browser data (localStorage)
2. Log out and log back in
3. Check console - should see: "Streak updated: current: 1"
4. Go to Profile - you should see "1 Day" streak display
```

**Method 2: Simulate Next Day Login** (Advanced)
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Manually set last login to yesterday
const streakData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('airdrop_tracker_streak'));
const yesterday = new Date();
yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);
streakData.lastLoginDate = yesterday.toISOString();
localStorage.setItem('airdrop_tracker_streak', JSON.stringify(streakData));

// Now refresh the page or log out and back in
// Your streak should increase!
```

#### **What to Check:**
1. **Console Logs:**
   - Open F12 Developer Tools ‚Üí Console
   - On login, you should see: `Streak updated: {...}`
   - Current streak number should show

2. **Profile Page:**
   - üî• Streak display should show current days
   - "Best" should show longest streak ever
   - If streak is 0, display won't show (expected)

3. **Firestore:**
   - Open Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
   - Check your user document
   - Should have `streakData` field with:
     ```json
     {
       "current": 1,
       "longest": 1,
       "lastLoginDate": "2025-10-21T...",
       "milestones": []
     }
     ```

---

### **Test 4: Streak Milestone Notifications**

**Milestones:** 7, 14, 30, 60, 100 days

**How to Test:**

**Method 1: Manually Trigger (For Testing)**
```javascript
// Open console (F12)
// Manually trigger a 7-day milestone notification
localStorage.setItem('streak_milestone_achieved', JSON.stringify({
  milestone: 7,
  timestamp: Date.now()
}));

// Wait 2-3 seconds
// Check notification bell - should have a badge!
// Click bell - you should see "7-Day Streak! üî•" notification
```

**Method 2: Actually Achieve It (Real Way)**
- Keep logging in daily
- When you hit 7, 14, 30, 60, or 100 days

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Streak Not Showing?**

**Check:**
1. Do you have any tasks? (needed for the system to track)
2. Have you logged in at least once?
3. Check console for errors
4. Check localStorage: `airdrop_tracker_streak`
5. Check Firestore: user document should have `streakData`

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Reset streak system
localStorage.removeItem('airdrop_tracker_streak');
// Log out and back in
```

### **Notifications Not Appearing?**

**Check:**
1. Open console - any errors?
2. Check localStorage: `streak_milestone_achieved`
3. Check localStorage: `airdrop_tracker_notifications`
4. Try manually triggering (see Test 4 above)

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Clear notification storage
localStorage.removeItem('airdrop_tracker_notifications');
localStorage.removeItem('streak_milestone_achieved');
// Refresh page
```

### **Level Not Updating?**

**Check:**
1. Add a new task
2. Refresh Profile page
3. Level is based on total task count
4. Check console for level info

### **Animations Not Working?**

**Check:**
1. GSAP library loaded? (check console)
2. Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
3. Clear browser cache

## üí° Tips for Real-World Use
