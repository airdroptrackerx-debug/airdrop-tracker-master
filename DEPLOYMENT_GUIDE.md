## 🛡️ How to Avoid Google Safe Browsing Flags

### **DO:**
1. ✅ Use a clear, descriptive domain name (avoid crypto-related typosquatting)
2. ✅ Keep your Privacy Policy visible and accessible
3. ✅ Use HTTPS (Firebase Hosting provides this automatically)
4. ✅ Add clear disclaimers about not being a financial service
5. ✅ Submit your site to Google Search Console after deployment
6. ✅ Monitor Google Safe Browsing status regularly

### **DON'T:**
1. ❌ Ask for wallet private keys or seed phrases
2. ❌ Mimic popular crypto sites (MetaMask, Coinbase, etc.)
3. ❌ Use suspicious domain names (typosquatting)
4. ❌ Redirect users to external wallet connection sites
5. ❌ Make false promises about guaranteed rewards

## 🎯 Firebase Hosting Configuration

Create `firebase.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
            "value": "nosniff"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-Frame-Options",
            "value": "DENY"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
            "value": "1; mode=block"
          },
          {
            "key": "Referrer-Policy",
            "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
