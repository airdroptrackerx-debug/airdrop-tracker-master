# 🎨 Theme & Readability Improvements

## ✅ Changes Made

### **1. Dark Mode is Now Default** 🌙
- Users will see dark mode when they first visit the site
- Theme preference is saved in localStorage
- Users can still toggle to light mode anytime they want

**Before:** Light mode by default  
**After:** Dark mode by default ✅

---

### **2. Improved Text Readability in Light Mode** 📖

#### **Problem:**
- Text appeared faded/washed out in light mode
- `text-muted-foreground` had only 46.1% contrast
- Hard to read descriptions and secondary text
- Gradient text was nearly invisible on light backgrounds

#### **Solution:**
✅ **Increased text contrast**
- Changed `muted-foreground` from `46.1%` to `25%` lightness
- Now much darker and easier to read in light mode
- Similar readability to dark mode (which uses 80% lightness)

✅ **Fixed gradient text on headings**
- "Support Airdrop Tracker" (Donate page)
- "Crypto Airdrop" (About page)
- Light mode: Uses solid primary color (readable)
- Dark mode: Keeps beautiful gradient effect

## 🎯 What You'll Notice

### **In Light Mode:**

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Descriptions** | 💭 Light gray (faded) | 🖤 Dark gray (clear) |
| **Muted text** | ⚪ 46% lightness | ⚫ 25% lightness |
| **Page titles** | 👻 Gradient (invisible) | ✍️ Solid color (readable) |
| **Overall** | ❌ Low contrast | ✅ High contrast |

### **In Dark Mode:**

- Everything stays the same! ✨
- Beautiful gradients preserved
- Already had good contrast
- No changes needed

---

## 📱 Pages Fixed

✅ **Donate Page** (`/donate`)
- "Support Airdrop Tracker" heading now readable
- All descriptions easier to read
- Crypto names and details clearer

✅ **About Page** (`/about`)
- "Crypto Airdrop" heading now solid color in light mode
- Feature descriptions more visible
- Call-to-action text clearer

✅ **All Pages**
- Any `text-muted-foreground` now has better contrast
- Consistent readability across the app

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **CSS Variables Changed:**

```css
/* Before - Light mode */
--muted-foreground: 240 3.8% 46.1%;  /* Too light */

/* After - Light mode */
--muted-foreground: 240 5% 25%;      /* Much better! */
```

### **Conditional Gradient Classes:**

```tsx
/* Donate page - Before */
<h1 className="bg-gradient-to-r from-primary to-accent bg-clip-text text-transparent">

/* Donate page - After */
<h1 className="text-foreground dark:bg-gradient-to-r dark:from-primary dark:to-accent dark:bg-clip-text dark:text-transparent">
```

**How it works:**
- Light mode: `text-foreground` (solid black, readable)
- Dark mode: gradient effect (beautiful, already readable)

## 🧪 Test It Out

### **To See the Changes:**

1. **Clear your browser's localStorage** (to reset theme to default)
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.removeItem('theme');
   ```

2. **Refresh the page**
   - Should load in **dark mode** by default ✅

3. **Toggle to light mode**
   - Click theme toggle button
   - Text should be **much more readable** now ✅

4. **Check these pages:**
   - `/donate` - Main heading now readable
