# 🔒 Security Audit & Fixes - Summary Report

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **SECURE & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES FIXED

### 1. ✅ **FIXED: Exposed Firebase Credentials**

**What was wrong:**
Your Firebase API keys and configuration were hardcoded directly in the source code:
- `src/lib/firebase.ts` - Had fallback values with real credentials
- `src/firebase.ts` - Completely exposed credentials (file deleted)

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Anyone viewing your code on GitHub could see the credentials
- While Firebase API keys are public by design (protected by Firestore rules), it's still bad practice
- Could lead to unauthorized access attempts
- Goes against Google's security best practices

**What I fixed:**
- ✅ Removed ALL hardcoded Firebase credentials
- ✅ Deleted obsolete `src/firebase.ts` file
- ✅ Updated `src/lib/firebase.ts` to ONLY use environment variables
- ✅ Added validation to ensure env vars are present before app starts
- ✅ Improved error messages for missing configuration

**Before:**
```typescript
apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY || "AIzaSyBU3J6bg--Jn7d41f_6pwfoHWMxDvMQ2Do" // EXPOSED!
```

**After:**
```typescript
apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY // Safe - no fallback
```

### 2. ✅ **IMPROVED: Firestore Security Rules**

**What was updated:**
Tightened access control for user activity tracking to prevent data leakage.

**Before:**
```javascript
// Any authenticated user could read all activity
allow read: if isAuthenticated();
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Users can only read their own activity, admins can read all
allow read: if isAuthenticated() && 
              (request.auth.uid == userId || isAdmin());
// Added data validation
allow write: if isAuthenticated() && 
               request.auth.uid == userId &&
               request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['userId', 'lastSeen']) &&
               request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
```

### 3. ✅ **ENHANCED: Privacy Policy**

**What was added:**
Updated Privacy Policy to disclose all data collection practices:

- ✅ Activity tracking (for live user counts)
- ✅ Usage analytics (airdrop clicks)
- ✅ Profile pictures from social auth
- ✅ Third-party services (Firebase, reCAPTCHA, EmailJS)
- ✅ Cookies and local storage usage

**Location:** `/privacy` page

---

### 4. ✅ **SECURED: Admin Analytics Access**

**What was fixed:**
Live user count feature now properly respects admin-only access with fallback for regular users.

**Implementation:**
- Admins can query all user activity
- Regular users see cached count (updated by admin visits)
- Graceful fallback if permission denied
- No data leakage
