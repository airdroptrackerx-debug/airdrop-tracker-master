   - Click the pencil/edit icon
2. **Delete** the default CNAME if present:

Value: 151.101.1.195
TTL: 1 Hour (or Custom: 3600 seconds)
```

Click **Save**

**Add Second A Record:**

```
Type: A
Name: @ (means root domain)

TTL: 1 Hour (or Custom: 3600 seconds)
```

Click **Save**

Name: www
Value: airdrop.site (your root domain)
TTL: 1 Hour
```

Click **Save**

## ‚è≥ **STEP 4: WAIT FOR DNS PROPAGATION**

### What Happens Now?

DNS changes take time to spread globally.

**Timeline:**

- **Minimum:** 10-30 minutes
- **Average:** 1-4 hours
- **Maximum:** 24-48 hours (rare)

### How to Check Progress

**1. Firebase Console:**

- Go back to Firebase Hosting
- You'll see status: "Pending" or "Connected"
- Wait for checkmark: ‚úÖ "Connected"

**2. Online DNS Checker:**

- Visit: https://dnschecker.org
- Enter your domain: `airdrop.site`
- Check if A records show Firebase IPs globally

**3. Terminal/Command Line:**

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
nslookup airdrop.site

# Should show:
# Address: 151.101.1.195 or 151.101.65.195
```

**4. Browser Test:**

- Try visiting: `http://airdrop.site` (may show SSL warning initially)
- Try: `https://airdrop.site` (should work after SSL provisioning)

---

## üîí **STEP 5: SSL CERTIFICATE (Automatic)**

### What Happens:

Firebase automatically provisions a **free SSL certificate** from Let's Encrypt.

**Timeline:**

- Usually: 15 minutes - 2 hours after DNS propagation
- Maximum: 24 hours

### Status Check:

1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Hosting
2. Look for your domain
3. Check SSL status:
   - ‚è≥ "Provisioning SSL..." ‚Üí Wait
   - ‚úÖ "Active" ‚Üí Ready!

### When SSL is Active:

- `https://airdrop.site` works securely
- Green padlock üîí in browser
- Automatic HTTPS redirect

---

## ‚úÖ **STEP 6: VERIFY EVERYTHING WORKS**

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES**

### Issue 1: "Domain Not Connecting After 24 Hours"

**Solution:**

1. Verify A records in GoDaddy:
   - Should be `151.101.1.195` and `151.101.65.195`
   - No typos, no extra spaces
2. Check @ symbol is used for Name (not blank)
3. Delete any conflicting records (old A records, CNAME @)
4. Try removing and re-adding domain in Firebase

### Issue 2: "SSL Certificate Not Provisioning"

**Solution:**

1. Ensure DNS is fully propagated (check dnschecker.org)
2. Verify TXT record exists and matches Firebase code
3. Wait full 24 hours before contacting support
4. Check Firebase status: https://status.firebase.google.com

### Issue 3: "Works on Desktop but Not Mobile"

**Solution:**

- DNS may not be propagated to mobile carrier
- Try switching from mobile data to WiFi or vice versa
- Wait a few more hours for global propagation
- Clear browser cache on mobile

### Issue 4: "www Subdomain Not Working"

**Solution:**

1. In Firebase Console, add both domains:
   - `airdrop.site`
   - `www.airdrop.site`
2. Follow the same DNS setup for both
3. Or add CNAME: `www` ‚Üí `airdrop.site`

### Issue 5: "Old GoDaddy Parking Page Still Shows"

**Solution:**

- Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
- DNS may not be fully propagated yet - wait longer
- Check DNS with online tools
