# 🔐 Security Audit Report - Airdrop Tracker

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Last Verified:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** ✅ **SECURE & COMPLIANT - PRODUCTION READY**

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ FIXED: Exposed Firebase Credentials
**Issue:** Hardcoded Firebase API keys and configuration in source code
**Location:** `src/lib/firebase.ts` and `src/firebase.ts`
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical
**Status:** RESOLVED

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded Firebase credentials
- ✅ Deleted obsolete `src/firebase.ts` file with exposed keys
- ✅ Updated `src/lib/firebase.ts` to use environment variables only
- ✅ Added validation to ensure all required env vars are present
- ✅ Added clear error messages if config is missing

**Note:** Your Firebase API keys were exposed in code. While Firebase API keys are safe to expose on the client side (they're restricted by Firebase Security Rules), it's still best practice to use environment variables.

## 📋 Firestore Security Rules Audit

### **✅ Users Collection**
```javascript
// Users can only read/write their own data
allow read, write: if isOwner(userId);
```

## ⚠️ Production Optimization Recommendations

### **Remove Development Code (Optional)**
The following console.log statements exist in production code:
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - 11 console.log statements for debugging
- `src/services/emailService.ts` - 19 console.log statements for OTP debugging
- `src/components/ContactForm.tsx` - 3 console.log statements for EmailJS debugging

**Recommendation:** These are non-sensitive debug logs but can be removed to clean up production console.

**Priority:** 🟡 Low (cosmetic, not a security issue)

### **Obsolete Files (Safe to Remove)**
- `src/services/emailService.ts` - OTP service (replaced by Firebase email verification)
- `src/utils/otpUtils.ts` - OTP utilities (no longer used)
- `src/components/auth/OTPSignupForm.tsx` - Old OTP form (replaced)
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Stub file (not functional)

**Recommendation:** Remove these files to reduce bundle size.

**Priority:** 🟡 Low (optional cleanup)

### **Environment Variables**
- ✅ `.env` file is properly gitignored (verified)
- ✅ Only `.env.example` exists in repository
- ✅ No actual credentials in source code
- ✅ Firebase config uses import.meta.env correctly

**Status:** ✅ Perfect
