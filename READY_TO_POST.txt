ðŸª‚ Built something for my crypto fam!

Tired of losing track of airdrop tasks? Yeah, me too. So I built **Airdrop Tracker** ðŸŽ¯

**What it does:**
Track all your crypto airdrop tasks in one clean dashboard. Set deadlines, monitor progress, stay organized!

**Perfect for:**
â€¢ Airdrop hunters juggling multiple campaigns
â€¢ Anyone tired of messy spreadsheets
â€¢ Crypto enthusiasts maximizing opportunities

**Key features:**
âœ… Track tasks across all your airdrops
âœ… Set deadlines & monitor daily progress
âœ… Beautiful, intuitive interface
âœ… 100% FREE forever

**Important:** This is NOT a financial service. We never ask for wallet addresses, private keys, or seed phrases. It's purely a productivity tool!
