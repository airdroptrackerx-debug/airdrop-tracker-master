**New Component:** `src/components/EnhancedEmptyState.tsx`

**Features Added:**

- âœ… Welcome message with animated sparkle icon

- âœ… Two action buttons (Add Task + Learn More)
- âœ… Example task preview

- âœ… Responsive design (mobile-first)
- âœ… Hover effects on guide cards
- âœ… Professional animations (fade-in, pulse-glow)

**Updated:** `src/pages/Index.tsx`

- âœ… Jumps directly to main content
- âœ… Works for both authenticated and public users
