   ```
   completionRate = completedTasks / totalTasks
   ```

2. **Category Selected:**
   - Based on exact percentage ranges
   - 0% gets special treatment (separate category)
   - 100% gets celebration messages

3. **Random Message:**
   - Picks random message from selected category
   - Keeps things fresh and interesting
   - Users see variety even at same percentage

4. **Smooth Animation:**
   - Fades in when percentage changes
   - Pulse glow effect for visibility

## Adding More Messages

Want to add your own messages? Edit `src/components/MotivationalMessage.tsx`:

```typescript
const messages = {
  zero: [
    { text: "Your new message here!", emoji: "🎯" },
    // Add more messages to this category
  ],
  // ... other categories
};
```

### Tips for Writing Good Messages:
1. **Keep it short** (under 50 characters ideal)
2. **Match the energy** to the completion level
3. **Use relevant emojis** that enhance meaning
4. **Be specific** to the percentage range
5. **Mix serious and fun** for variety
6. **Use action words** (push, crush, grind, etc.)

---

## Message Rotation

Each time the completion percentage changes, the component:
1. Checks the new percentage
2. Selects appropriate category
3. Randomly picks a message from that category
4. Animates it in with fade effect

**Result:** Users see fresh motivation even if they're at the same percentage on different days!

---

## Visual Design

The messages appear as:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  💪 Halfway there! Keep it up!      │  ← Badge with crypto purple theme
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
        ↑ Emoji          ↑ Message
```

**Styling:**
- Purple accent color (matches crypto theme)
